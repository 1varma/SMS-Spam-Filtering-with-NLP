# SMS Spam Filtering with NLP

## Overview

This project aims to detect spam messages in SMS using Natural Language Processing (NLP). We utilized the SMS Spam Collection dataset, which comprises labeled SMS messages collected from various sources for research purposes. The dataset includes both spam and ham (non-spam) messages.

## Dataset

The dataset consists of 5574 SMS messages, with 425 spam messages manually extracted from the Grumbletext website and additional ham messages from sources such as the NUS SMS Corpus and Caroline Tag's PhD Thesis. Each message is labeled as spam or ham.

## Methodology

We employed the scikit-learn library to build a classification model for distinguishing between spam and ham messages. The process involved:
- Data preprocessing: Tokenization, removing stopwords, and vectorization of text data.
- Model training: We trained a machine learning model on the preprocessed text data to learn patterns distinguishing between spam and ham messages.
- Model evaluation: We evaluated the model's performance using metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score to assess its effectiveness in identifying spam messages.

## Results

After training and testing the model, we achieved the following results:
- Precision: 1.00 for ham and 0.74 for spam
- Recall: 0.96 for ham and 1.00 for spam
- F1-score: 0.98 for ham and 0.85 for spam

The confusion matrix revealed that while the model occasionally misclassified ham messages as spam, it successfully identified all spam messages without any false negatives.

## Usage

To replicate the experiment or use the model:
1. Download the SMS Spam Collection dataset from the provided sources.
2. Install the required dependencies listed in the `requirements.txt` file.
3. Preprocess the dataset, split it into training and testing sets, and train the model using the provided scripts.
4. Evaluate the model's performance and analyze the results.
5. Deploy the trained model for spam detection in SMS applications.

## Contributions

This project contributes to the field of SMS spam filtering by demonstrating the effectiveness of NLP techniques and machine learning algorithms in detecting and classifying spam messages accurately.

## Acknowledgments

We would like to acknowledge the creators and contributors of the SMS Spam Collection dataset, as well as the scikit-learn and other libraries used in this project.
